      <h1> Festivals of India</h1><br>
      <p>India is a land of diversification. Every state has its unique art, culture and tradition. The one thing that is common for all states is the celebration of individual culture and tradition.<br>

        Indians celebrate their beliefs, culture and tradition in the form of festivals. Every festival has its own specific characteristics. Festivals in India are celebrated season-wise and state-wise.<br>
        
        The main reason for the celebration of these festivals is to spread happiness and strengthen the bond between friends and family. Many festivals are local and are held on different dates each year. A few are set according to the lunar calendar. The relevance of festivals in India is to honour a deity at a particular temple, celebrate the agriculture cycle or a religious story or event.<br>
